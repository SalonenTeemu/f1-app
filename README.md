# f1-app

This is a simple Formula 1 application build with Next.js. The app shows the race schedule, driver standings and the constructor standings of the current season. The app shows which races have already been finished, what race is coming next and the races upcoming later in the season. The application uses [jolpica-f1 API](https://github.com/jolpica/jolpica-f1?tab=readme-ov-file) to fetch the data.

## Running the application

The application can be tested on my [homepage](https://salonenteemu.fi/projects/f1-app) as it is one of the projects there.

Run the app with `npm install` and `npm run dev` in the project root directory.

Open the application in a browser at: `http://localhost:3000/`

### Note

The driver and constructor standings might not work before the start of the season so those pages will likely give an error.
