# f1-race-schedule-app

This is a simple Formula 1 race schedule application build with Next.js. The app shows 2024 season race dates, times and locations. The app also shows which races have already been finished, what race is coming next and the races upcoming later in the season. The application uses [Ergast API](https://ergast.com/mrd) to fetch the race schedule data.

## Running the application

Run the app with `npm install` and `npm run dev` in the project root directory.

### Note

[The Ergast API](https://ergast.com/mrd) is deprecated and will only be updated until the end of the 2024 season so sadly the application will not work after 2024.
